abstract = {Learning analytics has matured significantly since its early days. The field has rapidly grown in terms of the reputation of its publication venues, established a vibrant community, and has demonstrated an increasing impact on policy and practice. However, the boundaries of the field are still being explored by many researchers in a bid to determine what differentiates a contribution in learning analytics from contributions in related fields, which also center around data in education. In this paper, we propose that instead of emphasizing the examination of differences, a healthy development of the field should focus on collaboration and be informed by the developments in related fields. Specifically, the paper presents a framework for analysis how contemporary fields focused on the study of data in education influence trends in learning analytics. The framework is focused on the methodological paradigms that each of the fields is primarily based on - i.e., essentialist, entatitive/reductionst, ontological/dialectical, and existentialist. The paper uses the proposed framework to analyze how learning analytics (ontological) is being methodologically influenced by recent trends in the fields of educational data mining (entatitive), quantitative ethnography (existentialist), and learning at scale (essentialist). Based on the results of the analysis, this paper identifies gaps in the literature that warrant future research.}}

abstract = {Abstract Multimodality in learning analytics and learning science is under the spotlight. The landscape of sensors and wearable trackers that can be used for learning support is evolving rapidly, as well as data collection and analysis methods. Multimodal data can now be collected and processed in real time at an unprecedented scale. With sensors, it is possible to capture observable events of the learning process such as learner's behaviour and the learning context. The learning process, however, consists also of latent attributes, such as the learner's cognitions or emotions. These attributes are unobservable to sensors and need to be elicited by human-driven interpretations. We conducted a literature survey of experiments using multimodal data to frame the young research field of multimodal learning analytics. The survey explored the multimodal data used in related studies (the input space) and the learning theories selected (the hypothesis space). The survey led to the formulation of the Multimodal Learning Analytics Model whose main objectives are of (O1) mapping the use of multimodal data to enhance the feedback in a learning context; (O2) showing how to combine machine learning with multimodal data; and (O3) aligning the terminology used in the field of machine learning and learning science.},

abstract="This chapter interrogates the concept of technology as driver for change in professional learning and as a (potential) enabler for new forms of learning. Changes in technology-enhanced professional learning are influenced by the inter-relationship of work practices, learning processes and technology systems. Based on an analysis of current research in professional learning with technologies, we identify a number of important trends. First, work practice tends to be agile and constantly changing so professionals are tending to use technologies to support just-in-time learning alongside formal professional training and education. Second, with widespread adoption of digital media in society, there appears to be increasing reliance on recommendations from AI systems for learning alongside guidance from workplace mentors or experts. Third, employers and employees want to find ways to extend assessment of formal educational qualifications through accreditation of the outcomes of informal, work-integrated learning. To shape the ongoing transformation of both work(places) and learning, the chapter highlights the ways diverse disciplines need to align reflectively, critically, and constructively to bring together theories and methods from learning sciences, computer science and human-computer interaction to identify problems and engineer solutions. Finally, we propose three constructs that are critical for technology-enhanced professional learning, but often are not taken into consideration: the goals and motivations of learners, the work environment and structure, and the tools and resources available for work and learning.",

abstract="Open Educational Resources (OER) are teaching and learning materials that are licensed to provide everyone the access to engage with them in several manners, such as adapting and reusing it. This work aims at developing an OER to support PhD candidates' learning of research methods in Technology-enhanced Learning (TEL) as part of the Doctoral Education in Technology-enhanced Learning (DE-TEL) project. A survey was conducted by the DE-TEL project to collect information on the practices and challenges of doctoral education in TEL and to find out the topics that are relevant to the area but have few educational materials available. Preliminary results reveal that 103 PhD candidates from 25 different countries answered the survey. The main topic of their research in TEL is computing or information technology applied to learning, and the most relevant research method is design-based research. For this reason, a prototype of the OER module about design-based research is being designed and developed first. This paper presents the first outline of the prototype using the H5P tool, an open source and free to use tool that enables authors to create, share and reuse interactive HTML5 content, without the need for any technical skills. Then, this module is going to be piloted and evaluated by PhD candidates, so that the complete OER can be planned and created, encompassing the most relevant research methods to doctoral programs in TEL.",

It focuses in particular on the literature searching component, and covers systematic database searching techniques, searching for grey literature and the importance of librarian involvement in the search. It also covers systematic review reporting standards such as PRISMA-P and PRISMA, critical appraisal and tools and resources to support the review and ensure it is conducted efficiently and effectively. Finally, it summarizes the requirements when screening search results for inclusion in the review, and the statistical synthesis of included studies' findings. }
