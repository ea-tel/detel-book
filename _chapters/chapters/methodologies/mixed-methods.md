## Introduction

This thesis is based on the interpretivism and positivist paradigms, considering both as complementary. Regarding the methods used in the empirical phase, this research fits as exploratory-descriptive. At the same time, this research is framed as comparative/causal, which is used to find a cause- effect relationships between phenomena [31].

Regarding the techniques used for data collection, the investigation will be carried out in three phases. The first phase of the research will have a quantitative approach, in which the survey method will be used. This stage will allow characterizing the profiles of Portuguese university students who will participate in the study in terms of birth date, nationality, sex, the university where they study, the course and the year in which they are, participation in initiation rituals (hazing), time of Internet use and knowledge of the Internet. Participants will also be asked whether aggressive practices in hazing are transported to the online environment. Additionally, the questionnaire will acquire information about how university students perceive the hazards related to online aggression in terms of risks and their dimensions (e.g., the immediate consequence of the risk; the severity of consequences of risk), and to determine how they have been taking precautions against the dangers of cyber-aggression. Finally, the surveys’ last question includes an invitation to people who have been involved in cyber-aggression situations to participate in the interview, which will be the second phase of the project.

The second phase of the study, therefore, has a qualitative approach. It includes a semi-structured interview with people who have already been involved in cyber-aggression situations, whether victims, aggressors, or bystanders. This phase will delve into subjects’ experiences in cyber-aggression situations, causal contexts, repercussions of cyber-aggression, and ideas for elaborating public policies and actions to combat cyber- aggression in Portugal. Also, details about aggressive hazing practices in the online environment will be requested. All data collection will be done only after signing an informed consent term. Also, the interviews will be recorded using an audio recorder, transcribed, and analyzed through a content analysis that will be carried out through the NVivo software.

The third phase of the study will occur in conjunction with the other phases above. It includes the permission to explore and analyze the restricted digital contexts of a specific class,
such as closed Facebook or WhatsApp groups. It is intended to monitor two groups simultaneously, created by college students from two specific classes of the Universities chosen. The choice of these groups will depend on the participants’ permission and will only occur with the consent of all members. If no class of university students allows access to private groups, the analyses of open groups (in the social media) of the universities that are part of the study should be considered.

This investigation is framed as a multiple case study [31], with research conducted at the Universities of Porto, University of Coimbra, and University of Aveiro. The choice of universities was made considering institutions with aggressive cases in the beginners’ initiation rituals. Therefore, bearing in mind the history of aggressive hazing in the Universities of Porto and Coimbra, these Institutions fit into the thesis’ objectives. Furthermore, the University of Aveiro (UA) was chosen since it is newer and has its foundations built on contemporary pillars, so it will be enriching to obtain data from young UA students. Hence, the sample will be undergraduate students of the three universities mentioned above.

Data collection will occur between April and October 2022, with the first phase in three months (April - June) and the second between May and October. Phase three will follow the groups for a minimum of three months, with a maximum of six months. Further, all quantitative data will be analyzed using the SPSS software, while the NVivo software will be used for a content analysis of the interviews.

*Table 1* shows the structure of the empirical phase of the thesis in terms of methodology, techniques, and data analysis concerning each of the study’s objectives previously listed. In this sense, objectives are represented by numbers, i.e., objective number 1 represents the first objective mentioned in section 2, and so on. This framework reinforces the mixed methodology used in this thesis with qualitative and quantitative approaches.
